*Welcome to Aisya's tutorial book for Analytics Training Programme 2022*

We believe that transformation to a data driven organization is a journey that cannot be fulfilled by simple technology procurement or by hiring a team of data scientists. It is a journey that organizations must undertake with clarity, focus and agility with participation of stakeholders across all organizational levels.

The Analytics Training Programme 2022 is a programme that helps organizations accelerate transformation to data-driven enterprise with our Analytics Services such as Consulting and Training.

This guide is made to help you understand what kind of services we provide and what services to choose for your business to be ready for the digital future.

Here is a quick review of what content this guide has to make it easier to navigate.
